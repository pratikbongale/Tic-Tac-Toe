# Tic-Tac-Toe
An implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java using the MiniMax algorithm.

This algorithm includes two modules:
1. Implementation using General MiniMax algorithm
2. Improved implementation by extending MiniMax using Alpha-Beta-Pruning.

# Steps to run the program:
	> python3 ttt.py
	> It will ask you to choose which algorithm you wish to use, select 1/2
	> Which Algorithm to use :
		1. Regular Minimax
		2. Minimax using alpha-beta pruning
		Please select : _
	> You are the first player and your symbol is 'X':
	> Consider the board of 3x3 tiles(0 - indexed) and provide the position where you want to mark 'X'
	> type in x and y positions on the same line with a space in between as shown below:
	> Example: 
		0 0 
		1 0
		2 2
	> Range of acceptable values for x = [0, 1, 2]
	> Range of acceptable values for y = [0, 1, 2]

# Interpretting the output:
	> Sample output:
	Please provide position(x,y) to mark 'X' (range [0-2][0-2]): 2 0
	X X 0 
	  0   
	X     

	Computer plays :
	X X 0 
	0 0   
	X     
	States generated to decide this move :  16

	> As soon as you provide an input (here, 2 0), the current status of game board is printed.
	> The computer then runs the minimax algorithm to compute its move, makes the decided action and prints the changed game board.
	> It also prints the number of states it had to generate to compute this particular move(here, 16). 
	> At the end of game, the result of the game is printed along with the total nimber of states that were generated throughout this game as shown below:
  
	========== Tie ===========
	Total number of states generated by minimax with alpha beta pruning :  3847
